            <p>Hello, I'm Aarthy, a Master's in Computer Science student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

                My previous experiences are with Wells Fargo (2021-2024) and Amazon (Summer 2025). At Wells Fargo, I developed internal applications that were crucial for the regulatory compliance of the bank. During my stint with Amazon, I developed an agentic workflow to improve advertiser experience.
                
                Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Xability Design Lab where I help improve user experience and learner experience for Blind and Low Vision users.
                I am interested in software development and integrating AI/ ML into the development lifecycle.
                I'm currently in the lookout of full times roles in Software Development Engineering from Spring 2026</p></div>

            <p><strong>GroupMate: A Role-Aware Team Formation System for Academic Collaboration</strong><br>
                Team formation in educational environments often struggles to balance student interests, technical strengths, and project compatibility. We introduce GroupMate, an intelligent group recommendation system designed to automate and optimize team creation in academic settings. Leveraging a vision essay scoring model fine-tuned using arXiv abstracts and heuristics for novelty and originality, GroupMate classifies students into Visionaries, Collaborators, and Enablers. Our matching algorithm forms balanced teams by seeding groups with visionary students and incrementally filling roles based on skill complementarity and project fit.

            <p><strong>VINT: Accessible Video Interpreter (under Professor Jooyoung Seo)</strong><br>
            Creating good quality accessible audio description for videos is a time and resource intensive process. Harnessing the power of Image understanding, VINT generates quality descriptions according to a catered set of accessibiloty guideleines. The generated audio description is converted to voice using TTS and baked into the video, ensuring that the events in the video, original audio and the audio description are synced. It provides other features like binaural audio and audio ducking in addition, to ensure maximum comprehension for blind and low vision users.

            <p><strong>Dodging Detection: Evaluation of content-moderation models under adversarial evasion</strong><br>
                Toxicity is widely spread on social media due to the space being widely un-moderated. Some platforms employ moderation using human moderators, but that becomes infeasible to scale with a huge user-base. Our work does an extensive critical evaluation on existing content moderation models to critique on their ability to detect adversarial attacks and evasion tactics. It also includes a user study to understand the major differences between human-moderation and AI-moderation. We include critical results that can enhance AI models in the content-moderation space and propose guidelines for the betterment of crowd-sourced datasets and developing content-moderation models.

            <p><strong>Bi-modal analysis of social media for flood-water level estimation using instance segmentation</strong><br>
                We propose a novel approach to estimate the relevancy of posts with respect to flood before processing them further. Textual captions from social media posts can contain verbal descriptions of floods along with mentions of the location. Location is identified from text captions using named entity recognition. Depth information can be either directly stated with measurements or indirectly indicated using references which are identified for inferring depth in a location. The location metadata from social media posts is used for determining the location of the flooding event. The proposed flood nuggets extraction using relevant posts filtration (FERPF) algorithm devises a system to estimate flood water depth and location coordinates from the text captions and metadata from relevant social media posts filtered.
